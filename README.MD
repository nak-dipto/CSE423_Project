# Interactive Solar System Game
* Interactive 2D Environment: A multiplayer(PVP) game with a planetary system including the sun and several planets, each with distinct properties (distance, size, speed, and color).
* User interactions such as moving the spaceship and collision detection are integrated into gameplay.
* Planetary Motion: Planets revolve around the sun at defined speeds.
* Visuals include orbits and dynamically updated positions of planets.
* Control Simulation: Players can pause or start the game again by using the onscreen buttons.
* Spaceship Mechanics: A spaceship controlled by the player interacts with comets and planets.
* Collision detection between the shooter, comets, and the sun determines game progress.
* Comet Behavior: Comets move randomly across the screen, with potential collisions affecting planets (shrinking them on impact).
* Game ends with "game won" when the shooter reaches the sun.
* Game over occurs when the shooter collides with a comet or a planet.

### RULES:
* Player 1 can only spawn comets from outside the orbits and adjust the speed of the planets.
* Planets will move with random speeds and gets randomly positioned.
* The deep blue colored spaceship will start from the bottom middle part of the window and outside the orbits.
* Player 2's task is to dodge the comets and planets, reaching the sun and FEEL THE GLORY. OR ELSE- "WOMP WOMP"
